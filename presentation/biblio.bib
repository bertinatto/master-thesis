abstract = {Programmable packet processing is increasingly implemented using kernel bypass techniques, where a userspace application takes complete control of the networking hardware to avoid expensive context switches between kernel and userspace. However, as the operating system is bypassed, so are its application isolation and security mechanisms; and well-tested configuration, deployment and management tools cease to function. To overcome this limitation, we present the design of a novel approach to programmable packet processing, called the eXpress Data Path (XDP). In XDP, the operating system kernel itself provides a safe execution environment for custom packet processing applications, executed in device driver context. XDP is part of the mainline Linux kernel and provides a fully integrated solution working in concert with the kernel's networking stack. Applications are written in higher level languages such as C and compiled into custom byte code which the kernel statically analyses for safety, and translates into native instructions. We show that XDP achieves single-core packet processing performance as high as 24 million packets per second, and illustrate the flexibility of the programming model through three example use cases: layer-3 routing, inline DDoS protection and layer-4 load balancing.},

  abstract={Continuous traffic monitoring and analytics are fundamental to the operation of today’s networks. Network telemetry allows for performing fine-grained analytics on network flow or packet records for various use cases including intrusion detection and traffic engineering. While some analytics tasks can be offloaded to programmable switches, ultimately, telemetry data needs to be processed by analytics applications in software. These applications are highly specialized, and running many such applications concurrently to achieve high coverage is expensive. To reduce the resource footprint of software network analytics, we present a novel network monitoring primitive that consolidates logic which all monitoring applications require. The primitive can (partially) be offloaded to a SmartNIC and triggers applications only when required based on high-level traffic metrics, avoiding unnecessary and redundant computations. We identify eBPF and XDP as a natural fit for this task, and implement a prototype of our system on top of this novel technology. Our evaluation shows that the combination of conditional execution of analytics tasks and the use of modern packet I/O technologies not relying on expensive busy polling (e.g., as in DPDK) significantly reduces the resource footprint of performing continuous network analytics.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Denial of service (DoS) attacks have increasingly exploited vulnerabilities in algorithms or implementation methods in application-layer programs. In this type of attack, called CPU-exhaustion DoS attack, a few well-crafted requests may consume a lot of server resources, which is essentially different from traditional volumetric DoS attacks. Due to the lack of recognizable patterns, the traditional network-layer defense mechanism is usually unable to detect such sophisticated DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose <small>Coda</small>, a framework for detecting application-layer CPU-exhaustion DoS attacks in containers. <small>Coda</small> monitors the CPU time consumed by each connection and uses statistical methods to detect attacks. It traces system calls and other related information from the container based on Linux eBPF at the host level. Some specific system calls are used to indicate the establishment and closure of the connection, which in turn indicate the start/end of the request processing. After triggering these specific system calls, <small>Coda</small> starts/ends monitoring the CPU time consumed by a connection. An attack can be detected when the CPU time consumed by an attack connection is statistically different from that consumed by a legitimate connection. <small>Coda</small> has the following key advantages. First, it works with programs built in different programming languages. Second, it remains agnostic to the source code of protected programs. Third, it supports monitoring the container and is transparent to the container. Through evaluation of real-world attacks, we demonstrate that <small>Coda</small> can accurately detect ongoing application-layer CPU-exhaustion DoS attacks with low additional overhead.},

abstract = {Many versions of Unix provide facilities for user-level packet capture, making possible the use of general purpose workstations for network monitoring. Because network monitors run as user-level processes, packets must be copied across the kernel/user-space protection boundary. This copying can be minimized by deploying a kernel agent called a packet filter, which discards unwanted packets as early as possible. The original Unix packet filter was designed around a stack-based filter evaluator that performs sub-optimally on current RISC CPUs. The BSD Packet Filter (BPF) uses a new, register-based filter evaluator that is up to 20 times faster than the original design. BPF also uses a straightforward buffering strategy that makes its overall performance up to 100 times faster than Sun's NIT running on the same hardware.},

We exhaustively analyze all kinds of system calls and utilize different levels of monitoring techniques to reason about the behavior under perturbation. We evaluate ChaosOrca on three real-world applications: a file transfer client, a reverse proxy server and a micro-service oriented web application.

Developers can write programs in C or P4 languages and then compile to eBPF instructions, which can be processed by the kernel or by programmable devices (e.g., SmartNICs). Since its introduction in 2014, eBPF has been rapidly adopted by major companies such as Facebook, Cloudflare, and Netronome. Use cases include network monitoring, network traffic manipulation, load balancing, and system profiling. This work aims to present eBPF to an inexpert audience, covering the main theoretical and fundamental aspects of eBPF and XDP, as well as introducing the reader to simple examples to give insight into the general operation and use of both technologies.},

Based on these results, an effective mechanism is proposed to control the invocation of critical, from the security viewpoint, system calls. The integration into existing UNIX operating systems is carried out by instrumenting the code of the system calls in such a way that the execution is granted only in the case where the invoking process and the value of the arguments comply with the rules held in an access control database. This method does not require changes in the kernel data structures and algorithms. All kernel modifications are transparent to the application processes that continue to work correctly with no need of source code changes or recompilation. A working prototype has been implemented as a loadable kernel module for the Linux operating system. The prototype is able to detect and block any attacks by which an intruder tries to gain direct access to the system as a privileged user.},
